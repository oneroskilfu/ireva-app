# Replit Configuration Update Instructions

To fix the port binding and webview display issues, please make the following changes to your `.replit` file:

1. Open the `.replit` file from the Files panel
2. Find the ports section that looks like this:
```
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 3003
```

3. Update it to:
```
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80
```

4. Also find and modify the port 5050 section:
```
[[ports]]
localPort = 5050
externalPort = 80
```

5. Change it to:
```
[[ports]]
localPort = 5050
```

By mapping the localPort 3000 to externalPort 80, you're telling Replit to make your application available on the default HTTP port (80) when accessed from outside. This helps ensure that the webview will properly display your application.

## Why This Works

The Replit webview looks for content on port 3000 by default. By mapping port 3000 to the external port 80, you're ensuring that:

1. The webview can properly access your application
2. External users can access your application via the standard HTTP port
3. The port binding detection mechanism has a clear path to validate your application

After making these changes, restart your workflow to see the effects.
