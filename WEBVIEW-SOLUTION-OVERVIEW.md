# Replit Webview Solution Overview

## Problem Statement

Replit's webview expects applications to run on port 3000/3001, but our main application requires running on port 5001. This creates a challenge where:

1. The webview shows "Run this app to see the results here" message instead of our application
2. We need a dual-port architecture to support both the webview (port 3000) and the main application (port 5001)
3. Replit has a strict 10-second timeout for port binding during workflow startup

## Implemented Solution

We've created a multi-layer access strategy:

### 1. Dual-Port Architecture

- **Webview Server (Port 3000)**: Ultra-lightweight HTTP server that binds immediately to port 3000
- **Main Application (Port 5001)**: Full application with all functionality

### 2. Workflow Starter

The `workflow-starter.js` script accomplishes several critical tasks:

- Immediately binds to port 3000 to satisfy Replit's requirements
- Serves an attractive HTML interface in the webview with direct links to the main application
- Automatically starts the main application on port 5001
- Provides clear visual instructions for accessing the full application
- Handles process signals and graceful shutdown

### 3. User Access Options

Users can access the application in multiple ways:

- **Direct Link**: Access the main application directly through port 5001 (recommended)
- **Webview Redirect**: Click links in the webview to access the main application
- **Helper Scripts**: Use the provided scripts to generate the correct URL

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **`workflow-command.sh`**: Simple script that launches the workflow starter
2. **`workflow-starter.js`**: Core script that launches both servers with proper environment variables
3. **`open-main-app.html`**: Attractive interface displayed in the webview with access options
4. **`open-app.js`**: Helper script for generating application URLs

## How to Test the Solution

1. Start the application using the workflow from Replit
2. The webview should display the interface with links to the main application
3. Click on "Open Main Application" to access the full functionality
4. Both servers should be running and accessible

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that both servers are running (ports 3000 and 5001)
2. If the application fails to start, try manually restarting the workflow
3. Use the helper scripts to generate the correct URLs
4. Clear browser cache if links don't work as expected

This solution ensures compatibility with Replit's webview while maintaining the main application's required port configuration.
